- You may want to zoom into the image, a simple Ctrl++ will do the trick
- It's recomended to have a good light source directly pointed to the sheet in order to make it more visible for the camera
- You can press two times the space bar to change the image
- If one marker isn't detected, the script sould make a prediction of where the missing marker should be
- If there is no markers, the image won't be rendered
